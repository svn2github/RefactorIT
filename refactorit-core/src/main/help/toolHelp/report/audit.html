<h2>Audits</h2>

<h3>HTML report</h3>

<p>This kind of report contains two distinct parts:</p>

<p>The first one is a summary of found violations, grouped by category. High/Normal/Low mean the priority of those violations. The larger priority, the worse it is for your code - it may be potentially a very buggy place. There is also a number near to the each audit name. This number means the amount of found violations. You may click on the audit name and browser will show you the detailed information about this audit and it's violations.</p>

<p>The second one is a detailed information. It also has two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Header</b></p>
<p><i>[top]</i> link makes possible go back to the summary. The color of the header means the priority of this audit. Yellow means Low, Blue means normal and red means high.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Violations list</b></p>
<p>This part contains violation name, it's location in the source code and density. Some violations provide extra information about what shall be done in order to improve the code. It is located in the Corrective Action column.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Plain text report</h3>
<p>This report contains only detailed information part. Notice, that headers still present in this report.</p>

<h3>CSV report</h3>
<p>It is looking exactly the same as the plain text report, but uses comma as a delimiter and escapes double quotes and commas in the violations info.</p>
