<h2>Report Generation</h2>

<p>RefactorIT allows to export results that were received from running <a href="../refactorings/audit/overview.html">Audit</a>, <a href="../refactorings/metrics/overview.html">Metrics</a> or <a href="../refactorings/not_used/overview.html">Not Used</a> operations. Results may be presented in different formats. There is 4 formats available so far: <a href="formats.html#xml">XML</a>, <a href="formats.html#html">HTML</a>, <a href="formats.html#csv">CSV</a> and <a href="formats.html#plaintext">Plain Text</a>. Generated report is possible to use for a source code and it's evolution analysis. </p>

<h3 color="red">Warning!</h3>
<p>Report Generation based on a large results set is a not an instant process. Usually, it takes some time to process the report, so RefactorIT may freeze for a while. The larger results set - the larger is the waiting period. To avoid this - try to be the maximum specific while you are in the operation settings dialog.</p>
