<h2>Timestamps</h2>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p> If you want to timestamp your FIXME-like comments in source code, press the
  T button on the left side of the <a href="overview.html">FIXME Scanner output
  window</a>. This button  adds today's
  date to all comments in the current output window (if they don't already have
  a timestamp in a  recognised
  format).  <b>Note</b>:  Selection in the result panel
  has no effect here--all comments in the result window are processed by the timestamper,
  no matter which ones are or are not selected. </p>

<p> You can also sort results by timestamps. To do so, press the Filter button (<img src="../images/filter.png" alt="Filter button">) on left side of the output window,  select the checkbox in the dialog that appears, and click OK.</p>
