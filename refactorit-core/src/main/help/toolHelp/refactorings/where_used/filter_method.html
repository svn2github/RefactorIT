<h2>Filter Dialog for Non-Private Methods</h2>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p> You  can narrow down the results of
  a <a href="overview.html">Where Used query</a> by choosing different settings
  rom the query's filter dialog. The filter dialog comes up automatically every
  time  you run a Where Used query.  You  can also open that dialog later
  from the <a href="../results_panel.html">results panel</a> to refine the search
  by clicking on the filter button <img src="../images/filter.png" alt="Filter button">
  after you have obtained initial results.  The following screen shot shows the dialog:</p>

  </tr>

  <tr valign="top">
    <td>Interface usages vs. implementation usages</td>
    <td> <p>The  distinction between
      "interface usages" and "implementation usages" matters only when you are
      using "check supertypes" and/or the "check subtypes" option. 
      </p>
<p>
Interface usage means using any method in subclasses/superclasses hierarchy that has exactly the same
signature as the target method (for instance, using overriding methods counts as interface usage). </p><p>
      Implementation usage means using a particular method body--so,
       overrides don't count, but
      simply using the method through a subclass's
      method does (note that this would also count
      as interface usage).</p></td></tr>
    <tr valign="top">
    <td>Overrides</td>
    <td> If checked, RefactorIT  also includes
      all overriding methods in the result.</td></tr>

    <td><a href="supertypes_and_subtypes.html">Check Subtypes/Check Supertypes</a></td>
    <td> Reports usages that are invoked on subtypes/supertypes of the class that
      the method being searched belongs to; for more information and an
      example, see <a href="supertypes_and_subtypes.html">Supertypes & Subtypes</a>.</td></tr>

      on the same line will be merged into one line in the results panel.</td></tr>

    <td>Go to source in case of single usage</td>
    <td> If checked and only one usage is found then the result window will not
      be displayed -- instead, the user is taken to the usage in the source file.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Run with default filter settings next time</td>
    <td>If turned on, filter settings window will not appear again next time.</td></tr>
