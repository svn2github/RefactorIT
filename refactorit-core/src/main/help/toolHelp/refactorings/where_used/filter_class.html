<h2>Filter Dialog for Classes</h2>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p> You can narrow down the results of
  a <a href="overview.html">Where Used query</a> by choosing different settings
  from the query's filter dialog. The filter dialog
  comes up automatically every time  you
  run a Where Used query.  You  can also open that dialog later
  from the <a href="../results_panel.html">results panel</a> to refine the search
  by clicking on the filter button <img src="../images/filter.png" alt="Filter button">
  after you have obtained initial results.  The following screen shot shows the dialog:</p>

    <td> Report usages that are invoked on subtypes/supertypes of the
      class that the method being searched belongs
      to; for more information and an example, see <a href="supertypes_and_subtypes.html">Supertypes
      & Subtypes</a>.</td></tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>Group usages located on the same line</td>
    <td> If turned on,  multiple usages
      on the same line will be merged into one line in the results panel.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Go to source in case of single usage</td>
    <td> If checked and only one usage is found,
       the result window will not be displayed. Instead, the user is taken to
      the usage in the source file.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Run with default filter settings next time</td>
    <td>If turned on, filter settings window will not appear again next time.</td></tr>
