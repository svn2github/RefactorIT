<h2>Supertypes and Subtypes</h2>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p> For most <a href="overview.html">Where Used queries</a>, 
  you can specify  that RefactorIT should 
  also look for usages that are invoked on supertypes/subtypes of the type that 
  the item being searched belongs to. These options are called "check supertypes" 
  and "check subtypes".  Depending on  the item  being 
  searched, the filters are initially turned on or 
  off to yield the most expected result. </p>

<p> When checking for supertypes, RefactorIT also checks for supertypes of supertypes 
  and so on until the top of inheritance hierarchy ( <tt>java.lang.Object</tt>) 
  is  reached. Similarly, subtypes are 
  also checked in the entire inheritance hierarchy. </p>

<h3> Example</h3>
<p>Usages of  <tt>B.test()</tt> are 
  searched in the code below:</p> 
<pre>
class A {
  void test() {}
}

class B extends A {
  void test() {}
}

class C extends B {}

class Test {
  void test() {
    A a = new C();
    a.test();
    B b = new C();
    b.test();
    C c = new C();
    c.test();
  }
}
</pre>
<p> 
In case both filters are turned off, a 
single usage of <tt>b.test();</tt> will be reported. 
Turning the supertype filter on adds <tt>a.test();</tt> 
because <tt>a.test();</tt>  might potentially 
invoke the <tt>B.test</tt> method at runtime due 
to polymorphism. And finally, turning the subtype 
filter on adds <tt>c.test();</tt> to reported usages since C is the 
subclass of B. </p>
