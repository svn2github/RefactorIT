<h2>Filter Dialog for Variables</h2>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p> You  can narrow down the results of
  a <a href="overview.html">Where Used query</a> by choosing different settings
  rom the query's filter dialog. The filter dialog comes up automatically every
  time  you run a Where Used query.  You  can also open that dialog later
  from the <a href="../results_panel.html">results panel</a> to refine the search
  by clicking on the filter button <img src="../images/filter.png" alt="Filter button">
  after you have obtained initial results. The following graphic shows the dialog:</p>

  <tr>
    <th scope="column" align="left" width="30%">Name</th>
    <th scope="column" align="left" width="70%">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Read Access</td>
    <td> Search for places where the variable is read.</td></tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Write Access</td>
    <td> Search for places where the variable is written.</td></tr>

  <tr valign="top">
    <td>Group usages located on the same line</td>
    <td> If turned on,  multiple usages
      on the same line will be merged into one line in the results panel.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Go to source in case of single usage</td>
    <td> If checked and only one usage is found,
       the result window will not be displayed. Instead, the user is taken to
      the usage in the source file.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Run with default filter settings next time</td>
    <td>If turned on, filter settings window will not appear again next time.</td></tr>
