<h2>Filter Dialog for Interfaces</h2>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p> You can narrow down the results of
  a <a href="overview.html">Where Used query</a> by choosing different settings
  rom the query's filter dialog. The filter dialog comes up automatically every
  time  you run a Where Used query. You can also open that dialog later
  from the <a href="../results_panel.html">results panel</a> to refine the search
  by clicking on the filter button <img src="../images/filter.png" alt="Filter button">
  after you have obtained initial results. The following graphic shows the dialog:</p>
