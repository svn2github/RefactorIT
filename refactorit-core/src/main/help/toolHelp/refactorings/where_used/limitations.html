<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>
There are some usages that <a href="overview.html">Where Used</a> cannot detect. Due to limitations of the Java language, RefactorIT cannot report all usages (or lack there of) with 100% accuracy.  Thus, it is recommended that you double check before removing types, methods, or constructors reported by Where Used as not being in use.  </p>

<h3>Reflection API</h3>
<p>
Invocations or instantiations via Java Reflection API are not detected, for example the <tt>public static void main(String[] 
params)</tt> method that is invoked via reflection. More sophisticated examples include methods imposed by the Servlet API, EJB bean implementation methods,  and 
so on. Usually, Where Used will report no usages for such methods. </p>
<h3>Frameworks And Libraries</h3>
<p>If the project is a framework or library, 
there are probably some methods and types exposed that are not used inside the 
project, such as utility classes. 
If these classes are not used from within the project, 
no usages are reported by Where Used.  </p>
<h3>Usages in Compiled Methods</h3>
<p>If instances of types are passed as parameters to a compiled method, 
RefactorIT does not know whether some methods or fields of those instances are 
used in the method.  For example, a project contains several helper 
  classes that implement <tt>java.lang.Runnable</tt>. The intent is that these 
  types are instantiated and passed to, for example, a 
  <tt>Thread</tt> that runs them. As there are no invocations of the 
  <tt>run</tt> method in the source code inside the project, 
  no usages will be reported. </p>

<p> If an instance of a class is passed to a method from a compiled class (not 
  in the source path of the project), RefactorIT does not catch that object inside the method, hence, RefactorIT does not report usages of the class's fields or methods. For example,</p> 
<pre><p>
class Foo {
  public String toString() { return null; }
}

class Client {
  void test() {
    Foo foo = new Foo();
    System.out.println(foo); // foo.toString()
                             // invoked
  }
}
</p></pre>
<p>Although accordingly <tt>java.io.PrintStream.println(Object)</tt>, 
<tt>foo.toString()</tt> will be invoked, no usages of  <tt>foo.toString()</tt> 
will be reported due to the fact that RefactorIT does not catch <tt>foo</tt> 
inside the <tt>println</tt> method. </p>

<h3>Subtypes</h3>
<p> If a project contains implementations 
  of  external interfaces or subclasses of external classes, 
  their usages  might not be caught. For example, a  <tt>jUnit</tt> 
  test class extends <tt>junit.framework.TestCase</tt>. Its intent is to be instantiated 
  from outside the project and to be passed to a <tt>jUnit</tt> test runner. As RefactorIT 
  does not know about this, it does not report usages of the class. </p>
