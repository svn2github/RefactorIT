<h3>Numeric literals</h3>

<p>This audit rule reports use of so called "magic numbers". Code with many
magic numbers is often hard to understand.</p>

    <pre>
    class A {
        void someMethod(){
            int a = 5;  // "magic number" usage
            while (a < 10){ // another "magic number" usage
                doSomethingWith(a);
                a++;
            }
        }
    }
    </pre>
    
<p>You may want to refactor this code to something like this:</p>

    <pre>
    class A {
        static final int LOWER_BOUND = 5;
        static final int UPPER_BOUND = 10;
        
        void someMethod(){
            int a = LOWER_BOUND;
            while (a < UPPER_BOUND){
                doSomethingWith(a);
                a++;
            }
        }
    }
    </pre>
    
<p><b>'Manage numeric literals'</b> corrective
action will automaticaly propose to make such fields <tt>static final</tt> on run.
Read more about <b>'Manage numeric literals'</b> action below.</p>
    
<p>Optionaly it is possible to enable/disable reporting "magic numbers"
in collections` constructors. Check out option "skip literals when initializing collections".</p>

    <pre>
    void someMethod(){
        List list = new ArrayList(10); // can be skiped optionaly
    }
    </pre>

<p>You can specify list of numeric literals, that You would like this audit rule
to skip. Just add a new literal to list. '-1', '0' and '1' values are skiped by
default, but they can be removed from the list as well.</p>

<h4>Corrective actions:</h4>
<h3>Manage numeric literals</h3>
    Action runs a dialog, where You can perform following actions:
    <ul>
        <li>create new field initialized with this numeric literal and use it instead of numeric literal</li>
        <li>use existing field instead of numeric literal value</li>
        <li>(in case of field) make field '<tt>static final</tt>'</li>
    </ul>
    <p align="center">

    Main dialog</p>
    <p>Even if You run 'Manage numeric literals' action on a single violation, the action
    will collect all usages of this literal in owner class. Fixed violations are marked with
    green background. To fix violations select some of them (multiselection is supported)
    and press "<b>Create new field</b>" or "<b>Use existing field</b>" buttons.</p>
    
    <p>If value in SFC column is 'yes', it means that numeric literal was used
    initializing some field and that this field can be made 'static final' without
    any harm. Such violations are fixed by default on action run. But You can clear
    those changes by selecting these violations and clicking '<b>CLEAR</b>' button.
    However, the action will propose to make these field 'static final' every time
    You try to fix them using "<b>Create new field</b>" or "<b>Use existing field</b>"
    buttons.</p>
    
    
    <h4>Create new field</h4>
    
    <p align="center">
    <img src="images/numeric_literals_2.png" alt="Manage numeric literals: create new field" align="center"><br>
    Create new field dialog</p>
    
    <p>Select class where You want to create new constant field, select access modifier
    for Your new constant and enter a name for it.</p>
    
    <h4>Use existing field</h4>

    <p align="center">
    <img src="images/numeric_literals_3.png" alt="Manage numeric literals: use existing field" align="center"><br>
    Use existing field dialog</p>
    
    <p>Concede that You already have an <tt>UPPER_BOUND</tt> constant defined for this case
    somewhere in Your project. Just find this field in Your project using
    <b>"Use existing constant"</b> dialog and corrective action will replace
    numeric literal usage with constant field usage.</p>
