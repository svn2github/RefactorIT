<h2>API Snapshot / API Diff</h2>

<p>API Snapshot saves the current state of the API and contains information concerning signatures of methods, constructors, fields, classes, interfaces, and packages. Included are items with  all access modifiers: public, private, protected, and package private.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>To create an API Snapshot, select the packages and classes that you'd like to include in the snapshot - you can include the whole project by selecting the root of the filesystem. Then execute the snapshot command from the pop-up menu of the selected items.</p>
<p>To compare the current state of the code against an existing snapshot, select the code as you did when creating the snapshot, and then select API Diff from the pop-up menu.  API Diff compares API snapshots, enabling you to see the changes that have been made to the API.</p>
