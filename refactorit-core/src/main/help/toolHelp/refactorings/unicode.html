<h2>Unicode Support</h2>

<p>
RefactorIT has Unicode support.  You might need to change character encoding in the <a href="../getting_started/refactorit_options.html">RefactorIT 
  Options</a> dialog, because RefactorIT does not import source encoding settings 
  from the IDEs it runs under.
</p>

<p>
<b>NOTE: </b> RefactorIT does not support unicode escape characters outside string or a character literals. The limitation is a price to be paid 
for the speed of the RefactorIT.
</p>

<p>
Please write to <a href="mailto:support@refactorit.com">support@refactorit.com</a> if you find any problems with special characters.
