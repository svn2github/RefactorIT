<h2>Command Line Interface</h2>

<p>The <a href="../audit/overview.html">Audit</a>,
<a href="../metrics/overview.html">Metrics</a> and <a href="../not_used/overview.html">Not Used</a> operations can be
ran from the <a href="switches.html">command line</a> and by a custom
<a href="ant_task.html">Ant task</a>.  Results can be <a href="../../report/overview.html">saved</a> to files
in <a href="switches.html">various formats</a>, so they can be analysed by
spreadsheet tools, or, for example, sent via e-mail
to the development team as part of the nightly build.</p>

<p>Results with too much "noise" will tend to be skipped by people,
which is why Audit and Metrics results
are optionally configurable using <a href="profiles.html">profiles</a>.</p>
