<h2>Create Missing Method</h2>

<p>Creates a method that is called but does not exist. 
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>
To invoke, click on method invocation or select "Create Missing Method" item  from the pop-up menu in the RefactorIT Errors tab. 
<br>
<b>Note:</b> First have RefactorIT display the source parsing error and then right-click on the error.
<br>
<p>One way of forcing RefactorIT to display the Errors tab is to invoke a refactoring command (like WhereUsed, which might need to be invoked more than once). Invoking Clean and Rebuild might not show parsing errors.
