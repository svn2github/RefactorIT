<h2>Filter Dialog for Not Used</h2>

<p> You can narrow down the results of a <a href="overview.html">Not Used query</a> by choosing different settings from the query's filter dialog. </p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>The filter dialog comes up automatically every time you run a Not Used query.   To refine the search, you can also open that dialog later from the <a href="../results_panel.html">results panel</a>  by clicking  the filter button (<img src="../images/filter.png" alt="Filter button">) after obtaining initial results. </p>
<br>
 <img src="images/filter.png" alt="Filter dialog for Not Used"> 
 <br>
<p>The following table describes the fields in the dialog box:</p>
<br>
<table border="1">
  <tr valign="top">
    <th border="1" scope="col" align="left"><p>Name</p></th>
    <th border="1" scope="col" align="left"><p>Description</p></th>
  </tr>

  <tr valign="top">
    <td border="1"><p>Interface usages vs. implementation usages</p></td>
    <td border="1"><p>Interface usage means using any method in the subclasses/superclasses hierarchy that has exactly the same signature as the target method (for instance, using overriding methods counts as interface usage). </p>
<p>Implementation usage means using a particular method body.
      So, overrides don't count, but simply using the method through a subclass does.
      ( Note that this would also count as interface usage.)</p>

  <tr valign="top">
    <td border="1"> <p>Exclude public and protected members</p></td>
    <td border="1"> <p>If checked, RefactorIT will not  check public or
      protected members.</p></td>
  </tr>
