<h2>Weighted Methods per Class (WMC)</h2>
<p> The WMC metric is the sum of the complexities of all class methods. It is an indicator of how much effort is required to develop and maintain a particular class. RefactorIT sums the V(G) (cyclomatic complexity) of all declared methods and constructors of class to
calculate the WMC.  A class with a low WMC usually points to greater polymorphism. A class with a high WMC indicates that the class is complex (application specific) and therefore harder to reuse and maintain. The lower limit for WMC in RefactorIT is default 1 because a class
should consist of at least one function and the upper default limit is 50. <br>
