<h2>The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</h2>
<p>The DIP quality metric is a guideline to avoid developing software from designs that are:</p>
<ul><li><p>
Rigid: Difficult to change because they affect other parts of the program</p></li><li><p>
Fragile: Changes to the program causes unexpected errors</p></li><li><p>
Immobile: Harder to reuse because the high level modules depend too much on the low level modules<p></li></ul>
<p>The DIP states that:</p>
<ul><li><p>
High level modules should not depend on low level modules. They should both depend on abstraction
</p></li><li><p>
The abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstraction<p></li></ul>
<p>
The DIP metric calculates the ratio of dependencies that have abstract classes or interfaces as a target to the total amount of dependencies for a class. DIP ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 where 1.0 means that all of the dependencies, the analysed class has, depend on abstract classes or interfaces.
</p>
<p>
Although the DIP states that all dependencies in a program should have an abstract class or an interface as a target, this is usually not going to be the case. Somebody has to create the instances of concrete classes and modules that will depend on these classes. If a concrete class is not going to change much then it is more or less harmless to depend on it.</p>
