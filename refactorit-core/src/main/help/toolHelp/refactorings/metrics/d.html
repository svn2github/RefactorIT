<h2>Distance from the Main Sequence (D) </h2>
<p> This metric was proposed by Robert C. Martin and applies to packages where the primary rationale is that abstractness and stability of packages are closely connected. Often referred to as "The Perpendicular Distance of a Package from the Idealized Line A + I = 1" the ideal value is D = 0, namely, the more abstract a package is, the more stable it should be since it should have many clients that depend on its abstractions. </p><p>
Packages that are maximally stable (I = 0) and at the same time maximally abstract (A = 1) are considered good. Similarly, packages that are unstable (I = 1) and at the same time concrete (A = 0) are also "good packages." Other packages should be located on a straight line connecting these two points on an I to A plot. This line is called the main sequence. The metric measures the square of the distance of the package from the main sequence: D = | A + I - 1 | and ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. 0.0 indicates that the package is directly on the main sequence whereas 1.0 indicates that the package is as far away as possible from the main
sequence. </p><p>
Any package that is not near 0.0 is unbalanced and should be re-examined and restructured in order to define it more reusable and less sensitive to changes. Therefore, RefactorIT recommends a maximum distance of 0.1 from the main sequence before re-examination should occur.
