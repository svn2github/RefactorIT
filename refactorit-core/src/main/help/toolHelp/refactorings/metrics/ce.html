<h2>Efferent Coupling (Ce)</h2>
<p> Efferent Coupling (Ce) is also known as Outgoing Dependencies or the Number
of Types inside a Package that Depend on Types of other Packages.
 Ce is a metric for packages. In short, this measure
includes all the types within the source of the
measured package referring to the types not in the measured package.</p><p>
A large efferent coupling can indicate that a package is unfocussed and
may also indicate that it is unstable since it depends on the stability
of all the types to which it is coupled. RefactorIT recommends an upper
limit of 20.  Efferent coupling can be reduced by extracting classes from the
original class so the class is decomposed into smaller classes.
