<h2>Abstractness (A): Ratio of Abstract Classes and Interfaces in a
Package</h2>
<p>This linear unit metric measures how abstract a package is, in that it will
calculate a ratio of how many abstract classes and interfaces a
package consist of relative to the total number of concrete (non-abstract)
classes in the same package. Thus, an abstractness value of zero (A = 0) indicates a completely concrete package while a value of one indicates completely abstract. One can measure the abstractness of a package (A) using the following formula: <b>A = Na / Nc </b> where:</p>
<ul><li><p>
Na is the number of abstract classes and interfaces in the package</p></li><li><p>
Nc is the number of concrete classes and interfaces in the package</p></li></ul>
<p>
An abstractness value between 0 and 0.5 is reasonable since a
package is more open to changes of implementation. However, you should
also compare the abstractness value with the instability metric value to
ensure that you do not have a complete concrete and highly unstable
package. Such a package would be hard to change because of stability
and cannot be extended because it is not abstract. </p>
<p>If the abstractness value is near to 1, compare again with the
instability metric value to ensure that it is stable. Otherwise,
you have a package where the abstractions will be impossible to extend
since the package has no dependencies. </p>
