<h2>Number of Types (NOT)</h2>
<p> This metric reports the number of classes and interfaces at the class and package level and for the total system. Inner classes and interfaces as well as local classes and interfaces are also reported. The larger the NOT is for the total system the more complex the system tends to be, hence the potential interactions between objects is higher. This reduces the comprehensibility of the system which in turn makes it harder to test, debug and maintain.<br>
