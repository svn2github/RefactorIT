<h2>Cyclic Dependencies (CYC)</h2>
<p>The cyclic dependencies metric is an additional quality metric to
assess the quality of your code. This metric will give you an
estimation of how many package cycles in which a package is involved.
You should try to avoid having cycles to comport with the Acyclic
Dependencies Principle (ADP) defined by Robert C. Martin stating that
no cycles should be allowed in the package dependency graph. A CYC
value of 0 indicates that the package being measured is not engaged in
any cyclic dependencies with other packages.</p>
<p>Packages involved in many cycles are more difficult to maintain. If
you make a change in one cyclic involved package, it might have an
effect on another package that you were not modifying in the first
place because it is involved in a cycle with the package you were
modifying. So packages with cycles in the dependency structure should
be refactored because neither package can be used independent of the
other.</p>
<p>You can use the RefactorIT feature <a
 href="../dependencies/draw_dependencies.html">Draw Dependencies</a> to
get a visual view of the dependency structure between packages in your
project.</p>
