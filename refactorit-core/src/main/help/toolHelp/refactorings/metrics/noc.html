<h2>Number of Children in Tree (NOC)</h2>
<p> Also known as : Number of Direct Subclasses of a Class, this metric measures the number of direct subclasses of a class.  The size of NOC approximately indicates how an application reuses itself. It is assumed that the more children a class has, the more responsibility there is on the maintainer of the class not to break the children's behaviour. As a result, it is harder to modify the class and requires more testing. </p><p>
The upper recommended limit for a class in RefactorIT is 10 and the lower
limit is 0. If NOC exceeds 10 children for a class, this may indicate a misuse of subclassing.
