<h2>Direct Cyclic Dependencies (DCYC)</h2>
<p>The direct cyclic dependencies metric will determine the number of
mutual dependencies between packages. That is, the number of other
packages the package depends directly on and which in turn depend on
that package. Two packages are directly cyclically dependent if the
first package depends on the second package and the second package
depends on the first package. Cyclic dependencies on all levels are
maintenance nightmares and indicate potential places to apply
refactoring changes.</p>
<p>Cyclically dependent packages are not only harder to comprehend and
compile individually but they cannot be packaged, versioned and
distributed separately. Thus, they violate the idea that a Java package
is the unit of release. Consequently, this metric is useful to notice
cyclic package dependencies and catch them before they make it into your
software baseline. A DCYC value of 0 indicates that the package being
measured is not engaged in any direct cyclic dependencies with other
packages.</p>
<p>When direct cyclic dependencies are reported for a package, it is
possible to determine which packages that form the cycles by using
RefactorIT's <a href="../where_used/overview.html">Where Used</a> and <a
 href="../dependencies/show_dependencies.html">Show Dependencies</a> on
the package. Where Used reports the packages that the package is used
in and Show Dependencies reports packages that the package depends on.
The packages reported by both tools are engaged in direct cyclic
dependencies with the package analysed. You can also get a visual view
of the dependencies by using the <a
 href="../dependencies/draw_dependencies.html">Draw Dependencies</a>
feature. If you want to check if a package is involved in any other
cycles in the whole dependency graph, you can use the <a href="cyc.html">Cyclic
Dependencies</a> metric.</p>
