<h2>Depth in Tree (DIT)</h2>
<p> This metric calculates how far down a class is declared in the
inheritance hierarchy, where the DIT is the length from the class to the root of
the inheritance tree.  In Java, all classes have java.lang.Object as their ultimate super
class, which is defined to have a depth of 0. So a class that
immediately extends java.lang.Object has a metric value of 1. Any of its
subclasses will have a value of 2 and so on.  DIT is defined in RefactorIT for classes and interfaces as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>All interface types have a depth of 1</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The class java.lang.Object has a depth of 0</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All other classes have a depth of 1 plus the depth of their
super class</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p> The deeper a class is in the hierarchy, the greater the number of
methods and state variables it is likely to inherit, which makes it more
difficult to predict its behaviour. It becomes more specialised and it
can be hard to understand a system with many inheritance layers.
However, there is a greater potential reuse of inherited methods. </p>
<p>
A DIT value of 0 indicates a root while a value of 2 and 3 indicates a
higher degree of reuse. If there is a majority of DIT values bellow 2,
it may represent poor exploitation of the advantages of OO design and
inheritance.   RefactorIT recommends a maximum DIT value of 5 since deeper trees
constitute greater design complexity as more methods and classes are
involved. </p>
