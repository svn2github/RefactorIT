<h2>Density of Comments (DC)</h2>
<p> Density of Comments (DC) provides the ratio of comment lines (CLOC)
to all lines (LOC). Hence, DC = CLOC / LOC.   The density of comments
value will be between 0.0 and 1.0 and it can be used as a quality
indicator to see how much of the code is commented. So if the comment
density for instance is below a certain value defined by the project
manager, it indicates that the code is under commented.  RefactorIT
recommends a commenting of at least 20% of the code and a maximum of
40%. Thus, the lower limit for density of comments is 0.2 and the upper
recommended value is 0.4. Confer with <a href="cloc.html">CLOC</a> and <a
 href="loc.html">LOC</a> to see how RefactorIT evaluates these values. </p>
