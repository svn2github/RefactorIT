<h2>Non-Comment Lines of Code </h2>
<p> NCLOC is also known as (NCLOC, NCSL, and ELOC):
Non-Comment Lines of Code / Non-Comment Source Lines / Effective Lines
of Code.  It is used to determine the amount of non-commented source lines
of code. It counts all lines that are not regular comments, Javadoc
comments or blank.  The upper limit for NCLOC in RefactorIT is default 80% of the total
lines of source code and the lower limit is default 60% non-commented
lines for a class or a file. </p><p>
Please note that RefactorIT calculates NCLOC as follows: Only
non-commented method body lines are counted for a method; only
non-commented class or interface body lines are counted for classes and
interfaces; non-commented lines of all source files belonging to a
package are counted for the package. The implications are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Method declarations are not counted on the method level. They
are counted on the class / interface and package levels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Class or interface declarations are not counted on the class /
interface level. They are counted on the package level.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p> NCLOC for the class containing the code below is incremented by 7
due to the code lines labelled c and m. NCLOC for the broadcast method
itself is 5 (lines labelled m): </p>
<br>
<pre>  /**<br>   * Sends broadcast message<br>   *<br>   * @return &lt;true&gt; if message successfully sent;<br>   *         &lt;false&gt; otherwise.<br>   */<br><b>c</b> public boolean broadcast(Message message) {<br>    // Sends broadcast message<br>    // to all registered clients<br><b>m</b>   if (!isTransportAvailable()) {<br><b>m</b>     return false; // Message not sent<br><b>m</b>   }<br><br><b>m</b>   getTransport().broadcast(message);<br><br><b>m</b>   return true; // Message sent<br><b>c</b> }<br></pre>
