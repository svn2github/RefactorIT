<h2>Response for Class (RFC)</h2>
<p> The RFC is the "Number of Distinct Methods and Constructors invoked by a Class."  The response set of a class is the set of all methods and constructors that can be invoked as a result of a message sent to an object of the class. This set includes the methods in the class,
inheritance hierarchy, and methods that can be invoked on other objects. </p>
<p>
The RFC for a class should usually not exceed 50 although it is acceptable to have a RFC up to 100. RefactorIT recommends a default threshold from 0 to 50 for a class. If the RFC for a class is large, it means that there is a high complexity.  For example, if a method call on a class can result in a large number of different method calls on the target and other classes.  It can be hard to test the behaviour of the class and to debug problems since comprehending class behaviour requires a deep understanding of the potential interactions that objects of the class can have with the rest of the system.
