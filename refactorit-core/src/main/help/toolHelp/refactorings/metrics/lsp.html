<h2>Limited Size Principle (LSP)</h2>
<p>This quality metric determines the number of direct subpackages of a
package. Packages should have a limited amount of direct subpackages in
order to avoid a project solution where too many elements are placed in
one package. Packages with many elements are hard to maintain and will
consequently lower the quality of the whole project.</p>
<p>RefactorIT recommends that packages with more than 10 subpackages
are split up into smaller packages.</p>
