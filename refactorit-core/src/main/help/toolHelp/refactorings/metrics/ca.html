<h2>Afferent Coupling (Ca) </h2>
<p> The Afferent Coupling metric determines the number of classes and
interfaces from other packages that depend on classes in the analysed
package. Afferent Coupling is also known as Incoming Dependencies and 
Number of Types outside a Package that Depend on Types of the Package.</p>
<p> Afferent Coupling is a time consuming determination by looking at the couplings
between packages, hence showing which packages that depend upon each other.   The number of packages that depend on the analysed package is ann indication of the analysed package's level of responsibility.  If the package is relatively abstract then a large number of incoming
dependencies is acceptable and not if the package is more concrete.  For example, if you have more than 500 dependencies, you may want to reconsider the package's responsibilities. It will be very difficult to make changes to this package later when so many other packages are dependent on it.
