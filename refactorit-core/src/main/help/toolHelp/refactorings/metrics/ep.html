<h2>The Encapsulation Principle (EP)</h2>
<p>Encapsulation is a technique to hide implementation details from other modules. Only details that other modules need are exposed.</p>
<p>To comport the encapsulation principle a considerable amount of classes in a package should not be used outside the package.</p>
<p>The EP metric is measured as the ratio of classes that are used outside of the package to the total amount of classes that the package contains. EP ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 where 1.0 means that all classes in the analysed package are used outside of the package.</p>
