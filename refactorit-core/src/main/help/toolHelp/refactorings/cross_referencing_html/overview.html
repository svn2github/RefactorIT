<h2>Cross-Referenced HTML</h2>

<p>Creates a project's source code listing in HTML with cross-referencing links between items. Such that you can click on a method invocation in the listing to get to the source of the invoked method.  This command is useful for quick browsing of the source code when you are analysing the structure of the code.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p> Cross-Referenced HTML creates one HTML file for each source file, where the created files are named after fully qualified source file names (for example,  <tt>com.mycom.MyClass.html</tt>).   This command is available from different menus depending on how you are running RefactorIT: </p>
