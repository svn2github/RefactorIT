	<h2>Query Results</h2>

<p>
Most of the queries that RefactorIT provides report results to the output window or "results" panel. Results are presented as a tree. This allows you to concentrate on a desired subset. Clicking a tree node will open it in the source code window or panel and right-clicking a node will bring up a list of applicable refactoring operations or queries.
From the results panel, you can copy text to the clipboard and paste into applications for more complex analysis; e.g.  a spreadsheet, statistical package, or text document.
It is also possible to analyze the results there by viewing the changes log provided.
