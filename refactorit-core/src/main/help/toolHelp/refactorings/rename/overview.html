<h2>Rename</h2>


<p>Renaming is a commonly used  refactoring operation that enables you to rename methods, fields, variables, types, and packages. All references of the renamed items are updated accordingly.   If the code has been  compiled before renaming, it will also compile after renaming.  If renaming breaks your project, RefactorIT will report potential problems and ask for confirmation.  <b>Note</b>:  There are cases  where RefactorIT
  cannot detect that renaming will damage or even break your project. Examples
  include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>The project uses reflection (for example, <tt>public
    static void main(String[])</tt>, servlets, EJBs, JUnit tests)</p></li>
  <li><p>If  Javadoc comments are not
    updated during the rename ( which
    is configurable from the Rename dialog box), the code resulting from the rename operation
    might  cause warnings during Javadoc
    generation. Additionally, if you use tools that generate parts of code based
    on  Javadoc comments (DbC, EJB
    generation), the result is undefined.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>RefactorIT  does its best to preserve the layout of your code. Still, there are  cases where your coding conventions might be violated as a result of renaming. For example, RefactorIT does not follow the maximum source line length constraint.</p>
