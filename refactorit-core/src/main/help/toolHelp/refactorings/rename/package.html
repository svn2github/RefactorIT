<h2>Renaming a Package</h2>
<p> Renaming a package changes the name of a package and all references (FQNs, <tt>package</tt> and <tt>import</tt> statements) in source files are updated accordingly. </p> 

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>In the following dialog box, package <tt>com</tt> will be renamed to <tt>org</tt>:</p>
<br>
<img src="images/rename_package.png" alt="Rename Package dialog">
<br>
<p> Note that with these settings, <tt>com.company</tt> will <i>not</i>
  be renamed because "rename prefixes of all  matching packages" is turned off. For
  safety reasons, this is  the default behaviour.  Although packages are not
  actually  hierarchical in Java,
  there is an option to treat them as such and rename all packages starting with
  a particular prefix, as illustrated  in
  the following screen shot:</p>
<br>
<img src="images/rename_prefix.png" alt="Rename Package dialog">
<br>
<p> With the settings from the dialog box above,
  all packages  that have names starting
  with <tt>com</tt> will be renamed  so they start
  with <tt>org</tt> instead.  The
  package <tt>com</tt> will be renamed to <tt>org</tt> and the
  package <tt>com.company</tt> will be renamed to <tt>org.company</tt>. </p>
