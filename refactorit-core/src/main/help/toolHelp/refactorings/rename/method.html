<h2>Renaming a Method</h2>


<p>Renaming a method changes its name and all references in source files are updated accordingly. You can  rename a method if and only if it is declared in source files.</p>
<br>
<img src="images/rename_method.png" alt="Rename Method dialog">
<br>
<p> There are several  cases to keep in mind when renaming a method. RefactorIT
  automatically detects the following ones:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>When renaming an abstract method, RefactorIT asks to rename any  implementing or
    overriding methods.</p></li>
  <li><p>When renaming a method, RefactorIT asks to rename any overriding methods.</p></li>
  <li><p>When renaming a method that overrides a
    method from a compiled class, RefactorIT will
    warn you that it is not possible to rename the overridden method without possibly breaking the project.</p></li>
</ul>
