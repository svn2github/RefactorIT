<h2>Move Class</h2>

<p>This function moves a class or interface declared in source code to another package. All references in source files are updated where necessary and if possible, the source file in which the class is declared is relocated to follow standard package-directory mapping.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p> When moving a class you have to select the new package it will belong to. If no such package exists yet, you can add it in the package selection dialog. After you've selected the destination package,  click OK.</p>

<br>
<p> Note that moving local or compiled classes is not supported . It  is possible to move static inner classes (and some non-static as well), even to the same package; i.e. the class is extracted out of its old source file. </p>
