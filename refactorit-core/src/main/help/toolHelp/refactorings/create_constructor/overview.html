<h2>Create Constructor</h2>

<p>Create Constructor allows you to easily create constructor definitions from existing class variables. 
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>
Simply select the class variables and run Create Constructor and the constructor is created from the
selected declarations.  Create Constructor refactoring also works for inner classes and RefactorIT will report  when  creation of a
constructor is impossible or might break the existing project.
</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>
RefactorIT  attempts to preserve the layout of your code. Still, there
are some cases where your coding conventions might be violated as a result of
running Create Constructor. Thus, please review  each constructor after creating it.
</p>
