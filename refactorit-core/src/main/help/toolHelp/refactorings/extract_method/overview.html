<h2>Extract Method</h2>

<p>Extract Method  enables you to break large methods into more manageable ones. 
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>Simply select a section of code and run Extract Method and the code is replaced with a call to a newly created methods containing  that section of code.  If extracting the selected section of code is impossible or might break your project, RefactorIT will report potential problems and ask for confirmation. </p>

<p>RefactorIT attempts to preserve the layout of your code, but there can be  cases where your coding conventions will be violated as a result of Extract Method.  Therefore, please recommended that you review the results to ensure that your convention is maintained. </p>
