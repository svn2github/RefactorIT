<h2>Create Factory Method</h2>

<p>Create Factory Method  allows you to  create factory methods from existing constructors. The primary rationale is that when there are many constructors with similar parameters, it is better to  provide clients with factory methods  that have descriptive names or accomplish complex construction logic which cannot be accomplished in a standard constructor.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p> Create Factory Method  creates a static method with the
  same signature as a constructor. The method returns a newly created instance
  of the class  and Create Factory Method does
  the tedious task of delegating all parameters to the constructor for
  you; you are then free to modify the new method
  to suit your needs.
