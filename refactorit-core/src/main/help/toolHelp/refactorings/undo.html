<h2>Undo/Redo</h2>

<p>
Since RefactorIT version 2.0 has full undo support for all refactorings, the undo function will revert all files modified by the refactoring.  If user has changed the files, RefactorIT will ask for permission to continue.
</p>
<p>
User can also Redo every Undo such that files return to the state
they were before last Undo. So if user applied refactoring, modified files 
and reverted refactoring using Undo, then Redo will restore all these modifications.
