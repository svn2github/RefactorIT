	<h1>Integration with Eclipse</h1>
<p>
RefactorIT integrates with Eclipse version 3.0 and higher.  To verify that RefactorIT has been successfully integrated look for RefactorIT and several submenu items in the main menu.
</p>
<p>
RefactorIT uses Eclipse Project Settings to identify which source files are part of the project and to resolve all classes referenced in the project. Hence, it is important that the source paths of the Eclipse project are correctly configured. Since the source path is the root of the package tree that all external classes use in the source files that are available in the project libraries. A general rule of thumb is that if you are able to compile the project under Eclipse, then RefactorIT can handle it.
</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b>For RefactorIT to work with Eclipse under Linux, JDK 1.5 is needed for starting up the IDE.  For other usage (building your project) the Java version can be older than 1.5.</p>
