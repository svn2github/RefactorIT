<h2>Setting Up a New Project Under Sun ONE Studio/NetBeans</h2>

<p>There are two ways to allocate a project under Sun ONE Studio/NetBeans:
  follow the recommended guidelines for setting up projects or
  set up the project via a custom way.  This
  section describes how to allocate a project in the
  IDE so that RefactorIT can automatically detect its settings. 
  If you prefer a custom method, you can always set the
  project's settings in the <a href="settings.html">RefactorIT
  Options</a> dialog (Tools-&gt;RefactorIT-&gt;RefactorIT Options).</p>

<p>Assuming that your are at least using Sun ONE Studio 4, the following project is utilized in the examples below:
<pre>
 &lt;project root&gt;
 + lib
 &nbsp; - myjar.jar
 &nbsp; - servlet-api.jar
 &nbsp; - ...
 + java
 &nbsp; + com
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + company
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + product
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Mounting Source Files</h3>
<p>  For Sun ONE Studio/NetBeans to compile
  your project and RefactorIT to function, you must properly mount the
  source files and libraries.  Source files  (.<tt>java</tt> files)
  must be mounted in the default package directory on the Filesystems
  window. The default package directory is where the default (unnamed) package
  resides, in this example, <tt>&lt;project root&gt;/java</tt>. The default
  package directory usually does not contain <tt>.java</tt> files, but if it does,
  the  source files do not have "package ...;" statement as one of the first rows. </p>
<p><b>STEPS</b> </p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the Filesystem tab of the
    Explorer .</li>
  <li>Right-click  the Filesystems node
    and choose Mount-&gt;Local Directory.</li>
  <li>Choose <tt>&lt;project root&gt;/java</tt></li>
</ol>

<p>A new  mounted filesystem should now
  appear in the Filesystems tab. You can expand it to browse your  source files. </p>

</p>

<p>Note that if your project uses source files from other directories, you have to mount those source files as well. Ensure that you mount directories at the default package
  root.</p>

<h3>Mounting Libraries</h3>
<p>Custom libraries (usually <tt>.jar</tt>) are required by most projects as they
  contain compiled classes that a project uses. All libraries required by a
  project in order to compile, must be mounted. In Sun ONE Studio/NetBeans, any <tt>.jar</tt>
  file mounted in the Filesystems tab is automatically treated as such a library
  and is added to the class path when compiling. In our sample project, all
  external libraries are located in the directory "<tt>&lt;project root&gt;/lib</tt>".
</p>
<p><b>STEPS</b> </p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the Filesystem tab of the
    Explorer panel.</li>
  <li>Right-click  the Filesystems node
    and choose Mount-&gt;Archive (JAR, Zip).</li>
  <li>Choose one of your <tt>.jar</tt> files (for example, <tt>&lt;project root&gt;/lib/servlet-api.jar</tt>).</li>
  <li>Note: that starting from NetBeans 3.3.1 you can add multiple libraries at once.</li>
  <li>Repeat step 2 and 3 until you've mounted all libraries.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Checking Whether the Project Compiles</h3>
<p>If the project as mounted in Sun ONE Studio/NetBeans does not compile successfully,
  RefactorIT  might not work properly.
</p>
<p> <b>To see if the project compiled:</b>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the main menu, choose Build-&gt;Compile
    All (Ctrl+F9).</li>
  <li>Check  the Output Window  for errors.</li>
</ol>

<p>If your project still does not compile, you are probably missing an
  external library, thus mount it and re-compile.  If your project uses
   an external build script (such as Makefile, Ant <tt>build.xml</tt>) verify what that script does  to compile your project and mount the necessary paths in the Filesystems tab.  Usually, you have to add additional libraries to CLASSPATH. </p>
