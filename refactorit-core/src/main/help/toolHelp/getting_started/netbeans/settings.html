<h2>Project Settings</h2>

<p>You can always check/modify project settings via
  the Project Options dialog. To open the dialog,
  choose Tools-&gt;RefactorIT-&gt;Project Options from the
  IDE main menu or the same command via contextual menus. </p>
<p><img src="images/options.png" alt="Project Options dialog"> </p>
<p> RefactorIT can autodetect (refer to <a href="autodetect.html">Autodetection
  of Project Settings</a>) all paths or you can choose to manually 
specify the paths. </p>

<p> You can also specify the Assert Keyword mode such that:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>If enabled (disabled)
    the Java assert keyword will (not) be supported.
  </p></li><li><p>
  If set to "automatic" (the default option),
     RefactorIT guess as to whether or not it supports the assert keyword 
     by looking at the current JDK version. </p></li>
</ul>

<p> Using the "Ignored On Source path" tab you can specify packages or filesystems
  in the source path that are to be ignored. RefactorIT will act as if these 
  items do not exist. This is useful when you need to reduce memory
  requirements when working with large projects or temporarily hide
  parseable code from RefactorIT.  Ignoring source path
  items can sometimes make the rest of the code unparseable.  
  One way to solve this is to put the ignored items in
  the class path as compiled class files. </p>
