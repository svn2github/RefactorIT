<h2>Troubleshooting and Limitations</h2>
<p>
The VCS support of RefactorIT was tested with CVS only. </p>

<p>Since RefactorIT uses the same VCS commands that are accessible through NetBeans/Sun ONE
Studio's
user interface, it is assumed that all VCS commands work properly when invoked manually within the Sun ONE
Studio/NetBeans, therefore, <strong>please, ensure that all the commands of the VCS are functional before running RefactorIT on a VCS file system</strong>.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>If REMOVE fails for CVS</b>
<br>
If your server version is newer that the version of the cvs client Sun ONE Studio/NetBeans was configured 
to use (including internal cvs-client), then REMOVE invoked on a file sometimes results in 
"cvs [server aborted]: no such directory '\&lt;name_of_parent_directory\&gt;'". 
In this case, try to use another cvs client, for example command line client <i>cvs.exe</i> 
of the <a href="http://www.wincvs.org/">WinCvs</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>
The complete log of all the VCS commands called by RefactorIT together with accompanying information is saved into the
 <i>ide.log</i> file which is located under the system directory of your
NetBeans/Sun ONE Studio user home directory
(for example,
<code>/home/<i>username</i>/.netbeans/3.5/system/ide.log</code>).
