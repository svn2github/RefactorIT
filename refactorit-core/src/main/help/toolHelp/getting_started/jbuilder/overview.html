<h1>Integration with JBuilder</h1>

<p>
RefactorIT integrates  with JBuilder starting with version 5.  To check if RefactorIT has been successfully integrated, look for RefactorIT in the main menu.
The RefactorIT menu should contain several submenu items. In addition, you should see a number
of RefactorIT buttons in the main toolbar.  RefactorIT takes its source path and classpath from the JBuilder Project Settings. Click the link for more detailed information on RefactorIT specific <a href="../project_settings.html">project settings</a>.
</p>

<h2>Productivity! Compatibility Mode for RefactorIT</h2>

<p>
RefactorIT has Productivity! compatibility mode which could be useful if you have Productivity! and RefactorIT integrated on the same JBuilder installation.
</p>
<p>
Productivity! is a JBuilder plugin from  <a href="http://www.softamis.com/">AMIS Software</a> that can interfere with RefactorIT.  The usual clash results in an inaccessible functionality error, refer to <a href="http://www.refactorit.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1682"> RefactorIT Bugzilla </a>.  When RefactorIT is run in a compatibility mode (which can be turned on/off from the RefactorIT tab in the JBuilder Project Properties dialog), there will be less interference at the expense of removing RefactorIT menu items from the JBuilder structure view. Note: Restart JBuilder for the settings to take effect.
