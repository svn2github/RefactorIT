<h1>Integration with Oracle JDeveloper</h1>
<p>
RefactorIT integrates with Oracle9<i>i</i> and Oracle10<i>g</i> JDeveloper.  To verify that RefactorIT has been successfully integrated look for RefactorIT and several submenu items in the main menu. In addition, you should see a number of RefactorIT buttons in the main toolbar.
</p>
<p>
RefactorIT uses JDeveloper Project Settings to identify which source files are part of
the project and to resolve all classes referenced in the project. Hence, it is important that the source paths of the JDeveloper project are correctly configured since the source path is the root of the package tree that all external classes use in the  source files that are available in the project libraries. Please refer to <a href="../project_settings.html">project settings</a> for more detailed information. A general rule of thumb is that if you are able to compile the project under JDeveloper, then RefactorIT can handle it.
