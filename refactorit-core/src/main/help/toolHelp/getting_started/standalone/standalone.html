<h1>Setting Up a New Project In Stand alone Version</h1>

<p>The first time you run the stand alone version, 
  you will have to create a new project. <nobr>Click here for a sample project: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.refactorit.com/files/bingo.zip">http://www.refactorit.com/files/bingo.zip</a></nobr>.  The next time you run RefactorIT, you can open an existing project or create a new project. To create a project: </p>
<ol>
  <li> Click the Save As button.</li>
  <li>Select a target folder to save settings of the project to.</li>
  <li>Give a name to your project.</li>
  <li> Click Save and Next.</li>
  <li>Specify the source path of your project.  Click Add in the source path section and select  a folder containing your project files (<tt>.java</tt>). If your project uses source files from several directories, you have to add all  source files. Do not forget to add the directories at the default package root.</li>
  <li>Specify the class path of  your project via one of the two bulleted methods listed below. </li>
  <li> Click the Finish button to open your new project.</li>
</ol>
<p>For specifying a class path:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Click the Add button in the class path section and select the libraries of your project (<tt>jar</tt>, <tt>zip</tt>). Note that selecting  the directory where the libraries are located is not the correct approach. Instead, add the libraries themselves that are contained in the directory.</li>
      <li> Click Add all JARs in the class path section and select a folder containing your libraries. All libraries from that folder and its subfolders will be added at once.</li>
    </ul>
<p> It  might take several minutes but if all source files are compilable and all libraries 
  have been added, you should see a package tree 
  in the left panel. If parsing locates errors, it usually implies that a library is missing or some source code is not compilable and RefactorIT cannot compensate for the errors.</p>
  <p>Please click the link for more complete instructions on <a href="../project_settings.html">project settings</a>. To be able to perform refactorings in non-java files you may need to specify corresponding file name patterns.</p>
