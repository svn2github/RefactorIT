<h6>Refactoring</h6>
<p> The process of fighting "software rot" by improving design, readability, and 
  maintainability of code. Activities such as making code more understandable, 
  re-architecture of code, moving code, removing duplicate code, and so on 
  are collectively known as refactoring. The central idea of refactoring is that 
  changing the code must not change functionality;  only the changes that retain 
  the code's functionality are considered refactoring changes.</p>
