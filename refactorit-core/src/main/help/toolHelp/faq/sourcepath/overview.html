<h2>How to refactor a small portion of a project</h2>

<p>If you are only developing subsection of a much larger project, then you may wish to set the subdirectory as a "source path" for RefactorIT. In order to satisfy dependencies, RefactorIT needs to know the ".class" files of the rest of the
project. This is accomplished by adding the directory containing these
classes to the "classpath" which may or may not contain your current development classes. Version instructions:<br>
</p>

	<li>Go to the Options dialog box (Project-&gt;Options) or, create a New Project. (Hint: Use double-click to edit.)</li>
	<li>Set the source sub-directory you want to work with as the "sourcepath." This should only be one entry.</li>
	<li>Set the directory containing <em>all</em> compiled classes as the "classpath."  Add any other required libraries as needed.</li>
	<li>Click OK and select File-&gt;Save to save the new project settings.</li>
	<li>Reload the project via File-&gt;Open.</li>
