	<h2>Can not perform refactorings on selected item</h2>

	<p>  Usually this means that the class you clicked on/in is out of RefactorIT scope, i.e. it is located outside of the sourcepaths set in RefactorIT project properties. By default the paths are autodetected basing on the IDE project settings, but can be overriden as well. Check the RefactorIT Help for the detailed instructions.</p>
