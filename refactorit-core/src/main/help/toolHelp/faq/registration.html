<h2>Registration - Can not connect to RefactorIT server</h2>

<p> Sometimes registration process fails because of a firewall or some other network problems. Try to find the correct firewall settings for your network and enter it in the appropriate page in the RefactorIT registration dialog.</p>

<h3>Registering via browser</h3>

<p> If nothing helps it is still possible to register through the browser. The template of the address is:
<a href="http://activation.refactorit.com/ipay/keychecker/?site_user=&amp;pass=&amp;key=&amp;system_user=&amp;send_license=1&amp;send_method=direct"  target=_blank>http://activation.refactorit.com/ipay/keychecker/?  site_user=&amp;pass=&amp;key=&amp;system_user=  &amp;send_license=1&amp;send_method=direct</a>

<p>You just need to fill in the missing details (after '=' signs):</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>site_user - your account name on our site</li></p>
	<li><p>pass - the password on the site</li></p>
	<li><p>key - activation key you should have received by the mail</li></p>
	<li><p>system_user - login name on your operating system, the license will work with this user only (case sensitive)</li></p>
</ol>
	
<p> If everything is correct you will a receive binary stream that must be saved into a file refactorit.license and can be imported into RefactorIT with the 'Activate...' button in the About RefactorIT dialog.</p>

<h3>Support contact</h3>

<p>In case of a problem with registering through the browser you will receive a page with a single number in the upper-left corner and must contact us at <a href="mailto:support@refactorit.com">support@refactorit.com</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can just send us your system user name (login) mentioned above and we generate the license for you.</p>
